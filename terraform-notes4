Debugging Terraform
-----------------------

Terraform has detailed logs which can be enabled by setting the TF_LOG environment variable to any value.

You can set TF_LOG to one of the log levels TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN or ERROR to change the verbosity of the logs.

TRACE is the most verbose and is the default if TF_LOG is not set.

To persist logged output you can set TF_LOG_PATH in order to force the log to always be appended to a specific file when logging is enabled.


Dynamic Blocs
----------------

Dynamic Block allows us to dynamically construct repeatable nested blocks which is supported inside resource, data, provider, and provisioner blocks:

dynamic "ingress" {
  for_each = var.ingress_ports
  content {
    from_port = ingress.value
    to_port = ingress.value
    protocol = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

Example:

variable "sg_ports" {
  type = list(number)
  description = "list of ingress ports"
  default = [8200, 8201, 8300, 9200, 9500]
}

resource "aws_security_group" "dynamicsg" {
  name = "dynamic-sg"
  description = "Ingress for Vault"


  dynamic "ingress" {
    for_each = var.sg_ports
    content {
      from_port = ingress.value
      to_port = ingress.value
      protocol = "tcp"
      cidr_blocks = [0.0.0.0/0]
    }
  }
}
