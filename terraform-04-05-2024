Basic of Variables
-------------------

Terraform input variables are used to pass certain values from outside of the configuration


resource "aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule" "allow_tls_ipv4" {
  security_group_id = aws_security_group.allow_tls.id
  cidr_ipv4         = var.vpn_ip
  from_port         = var.app_port
  ip_potocol        = "tcp"
  to_port           = var.app_port
}


Benefits:

1. Update important values in one central place instead of searching and replacing them throughout the code, saving time and potential mistakes.

2. No need to touch the core Terraform config giles. This can avoid human error.


Terraform terraform.tfvars file
----------------------------------


This file will be the first source were terraform will try to take variable values from.

It can be useful in the real world because usually we have different environments (dev/stage/prod) and this will help us to have different values in different environments.


The file name for those files will be something like dev.tfvars / stage.tfvars

to run the commands we need to specify the -var-file="/path/to/file.tfvars"
