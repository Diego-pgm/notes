Branches on GitHub
---------------------

Merging locally
----------------

To merge locally:

(master) $ git merge <branch-to-merge>

and then as the changes are in our local repo and not in GitHub we have to push our changes.

It is a good practice after merging with the master branch to delete the unused branches.

Delete branch from local repo

$ git branch -d <branch-name>

Delete branch reference to origin

$ git fetch -p


Creting branches in Github
----------------------------

If we create a branch on Github amd we do a "git fetch" command, we dont need to specify the -b flag when trying to do a "git checkout" on the new branch created from GitHub


Get Git configurations
-----------------------

$ git config --global -e


Delete from local repo a remote branch
---------------------------------------

$ git push origin :<branch-to-delete>

git push origin :feature/branch-to-delete

Rebase
-------

Rebase "rewinds" the current commits that are on the branch to a point where the branch you're merging in originally diverged

so if I change something in the repo before doing a "git pull" to safely be ahead of the remote github repo we specify the --rebase flag.

$ git pull --rebase

This will keep the changes that we made and will pull the changes made in Github
