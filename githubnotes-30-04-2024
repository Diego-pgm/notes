Branches on GitHub
---------------------

Merging locally
----------------

To merge locally:

(master) $ git merge <branch-to-merge>

and then as the changes are in our local repo and not in GitHub we have to push our changes.

It is a good practice after merging with the master branch to delete the unused branches.

Delete branch from local repo

$ git branch -d <branch-name>

Delete branch reference to origin

$ git fetch -p
